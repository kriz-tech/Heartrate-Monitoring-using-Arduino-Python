# Real-time-Heart-rate-Monitor-using-Arduino-and-Python.
A real-time heart rate-measuring biomedical system via a Pulse Sensor attached to an Arduino UNO and plotted via a GUI with a Python foundation. Real-time BPM, noise-removal signal processing, health class, and emoji-driven dynamic UI in response to the patient's state are aspects included in the project.

Workflow:

    Start GUI ‚Äì User enters the patient‚Äôs name.

    Calibration Phase ‚Äì Sensor stabilizes for 5 seconds.

    Measurement Phase ‚Äì 20 seconds of heart rate data is collected.

    Signal Smoothing ‚Äì Raw data is filtered using moving average.

    Peak Detection ‚Äì Peaks corresponding to heartbeats are identified.

    BPM Calculation ‚Äì BPM is computed from time intervals between peaks.

    Display Results ‚Äì Final BPM and health status are shown in GUI.

How the Sensor will work?

   The pulse sensor operates using Photoplethysmography (PPG):

    It consists of an LED and a photodiode.

    The LED emits light onto the skin.

    The amount of reflected light changes with blood volume in the tissue.

    The photodiode detects these changes, producing an analog signal.

    This analog waveform is processed to determine heartbeats.

Based on the BPM, the program determines the heart condition:

        BPM = 0 ‚Üí No pulse detected ‚Üí ‚ùå

        BPM < 60 ‚Üí Low Heart Rate ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è

        60 ‚â§ BPM ‚â§ 100 ‚Üí Normal ‚Üí ‚úÖ

        BPM > 100 ‚Üí High Heart Rate ‚Üí üö®
