# Heartrate-Monitoring-using-Arduino-Python
A real-time simple heart rate-measuring biomedical system via a Pulse Sensor attached to an Arduino UNO and plotted via a GUI with a Python foundation. Real-time BPM, noise-removal signal processing, health class, and emoji-driven dynamic UI in response to the patient's state are aspects included in the project.
